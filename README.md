# Codeminer42 Frontend Test - Medical Dashboard

This project was developed by me (Alan Brito Barros) with the requirements and specifications given by Codeminer42. It was developed from november 25th to december 2nd.

## Technologies used

This project was created using React, a javascript library for building user interfaces. There were some external libraries used in this project:
- [x] Axios: This project used axios as a HTTP Client for fetching de data of the API.

- [x] React-router-dom: This project used react router dom for the routing of the application (transition between the dashboard page and the patient details page)

- [x] Date-fns: This project used date-fns, which is a very useful and powerful library to deal with dates. 

## How to run the application

  - With your prompt opened in the project directory, you can run 'yarn install'/'npm install' to install the node modules folder with all the project dependencies in.
  - After the end of the instalation, you can run 'yarn start'/'npm start'. A window in the browser will show up (localhost:3000) and will start loading. After +- 10 seconds the application will show up.
